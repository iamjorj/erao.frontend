            Erao was born from a simple frustration: why do you need to know SQL to ask your own database a question? We're building a world where anyone—not just engineers—can get instant insights from their data.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600">
              To eliminate the gap between asking a question and getting an answer from your data. No SQL. No waiting. No middlemen.

            <p>
              Every day, thousands of business decisions are delayed because someone needs to ask a developer to write a SQL query. Product managers wait for usage stats. Sales teams wait for pipeline reports. Support teams wait for customer history.
            </p>
            <p>
              We started Erao to fix this. By combining modern AI with a deep understanding of databases, we've built a tool that lets anyone—regardless of technical background—have a conversation with their data.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, teams use Erao to get instant answers to questions that used to take hours or days. And we're just getting started.
